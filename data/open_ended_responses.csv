I also found it challenging that Exams #2 and #3 were scheduled so close together (within 1 week of each other).  Prepping for these two Exams almost concurrently was difficult. I believe that had we had more breathing room in terms of the pace of this course, I might have performed better on Exam #2.","The repetition of exposure to course-related concepts.  I believe this repeated introduction to the course material through different mediums (reading, reading guides, pre-lesson quizzes, online lectures, class discussion/responses, weekly quizzes, etc.) really helped reinforce my grasp of the material, and thus my learning.",,"I really enjoyed this class.  Dr. Shaffer is an excellent professor, and I learned a lot.","I appreciate your study of learning methods and how students learn.  This is an important area of study, and I am gratified to know that interest and care is being applied in this arena.","I had to address some health issues of my own, which interfered a bit with my study schedule. ",,,,,Yes,,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,,,,"Instead of setting aside full days and putting off my coursework until those days, I evenly spaced out the required readings and assignments over all days of the week.  I spent on average about 5 hours every day on the assigned readings and coursework for this class. This is a huge departure for me, as I have a learning disability that typically compels me to hyper-focus (I develop ""tunnel vision"") on the material of one specific course at a time.  I was taking another class concurrently, and it was challenging for me to pull myself away from my other course to focus on this one and vice versa.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this new approach of balancing my attention between coursework for both classes actually helped me engage more fully in the subject matter, as I was engaging with it on a daily basis.  It also went really far in preventing the typical ""burn out"" and mental fatigue I've developed in the past. Another way I adjusted my study plan was to really focus on completing the reading guides very thoroughly.  I didn't quite understand their importance until we'd started, but after the first week, I saw how I grasped the concepts more thoroughly than I had in the past.  While getting a good grade in this class is important to me on a personal level, challenging myself intellectually and really GRASPING this course material is my ultimate goal.  Adjusting my approach towards my completion of the Reading Guides helped a lot in that regard.","I changed my study plan in order to adapt to the demands of this course.  I didn't have a full grasp of what the course would demand of me - both intellectually and time-wise - before I started the course; once the class started, however, and I got a better feel for the format and the pace, I adapted my approach to fulfill the requirements and maximize my engagement with the material.",,"I will do my best to keep up with the pace and not be late with any assigned materials; however, I have learning disability that occasionally makes this difficult for me.","I've been fascinated with the science of cooking ever since I was a child, when my grandmother loaned me her copy of ""Kitchen Science: A Guide to Knowing the Hows and Whys for Fun and Success in the Kitchen"" by Howard Hillman. I'd always loved cooking with her, and all of a sudden I was introduced into an entirely new lens through which to appreciate working with food!  I was hooked.
